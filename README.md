# Algoriths_and_data_structure

1. Implement a deque using a static array. Program these operations for a deque:  


pushBack() – to add an element at the end of a deque,
pushFront() – to add an element at the beginning of a deque,
popFront() – to delete an element from the end of a deque,
popBack() – to delete an element from the beginning of a deque,
isEmpty() – to check whether a deque is empty,
isFull() – to check whether a deque is full,
display() – to print a deque,
clear() –  to clear a deque,
size() – to show the size of a deque.

2. Implement a singly circularly linked list. Create these separate functions:

addNode()/insert() – to add a new element at:
the beginning of the list,
some position in the list,
the end of the list,
deleteNode() – to delete an element at:  
the beginning of the list,
some position in the list,
the end of the list,
search() – to find an element in the list,
isEmpty() – to check whether a list is empty,
display() – to print a list.
